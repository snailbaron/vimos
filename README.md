# VimOS README

This project aims to bring the fascinating **VimOS** to the world.

## What is VimOS?

VimOS aims to utilize the power of Vim editor to bring happiness and enjoyment to the world.

## How do I get started?

Grab the repo

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/snailbaron/vimos.git

and explore it.

## Directory layout

* **workspace** - A meta-application. The entry point for the whole VimOS thing.
* **apps** - Stand-alone Vim "applications", can be run independently.

## How to run something?

Just go into the directory with some stuff (e.g. *apps*), and do

    gvim -S <app file>

I suggest trying

    gvim -S calc.vim

for example.

## Where to get more info?

I suggest you go to the [VimOS Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/snailbaron/vimos/wiki).
